The package contains a launch file:
`roslaunch scarabot display.launch`
The launcher opens two terminal, where the first outputs the publisher's data and the second one gives two option:
- Manual mode
- Automatic mode
The manual mode gives you the possibility to calculate the forward and the inverse kinematic by directly typing the values.
The automatic mode just calculate the two kinematics from RViz
